== Own Your Conversations

CJSON (**Conversation JSON**) is an open standard for portable conversation data across AI tools/applications.

With CJSON, you can:

* Build editors, analyzers, and visualizers on top of a shared format.
* Move your conversations between tools and providers without lock-in.
* Ensure long-term ownership of your data.

== What is CJSON?

CJSON defines a structured, vendor-neutral JSON schema for conversation data.
It includes:

* **Messages** â€“ text, media, tool calls, results.
* **Metadata** â€“ timestamps, participants, context.
* **Streaming & patches** â€“ optional support for incremental updates.

== Why CJSON?

I've been developing AI tools as a hobby-project, and everytime I'd face the same set of questions around the data modeling for the conversation data.

In general, many AI tools that allow users to create chats/conversations with AI models tend to share a similar subset of elements: from the definition of the models the user wants to use/connect to, the way the conversations are presented to the user, and the definition of the tools (MCP or not) that the user wants to provide to the models.

I wanted to have a model that would allow developers to build on-top of a shared standard and that would be portable and transparent. And wanted to be able to see my conversation data in both a web interface and an IDE â€“ there is no reason this shouldn't be possible! Except that, I can't easily export my conversation data from one tool to the other ðŸ˜… (at least, not yet!).

CJSON started from all of the above.

It's in early versions. Input from other use cases or even from using it is more than welcome such that, with time, it can grow into a more robust and complete spec.

* **Portability** :: Export/import your conversations with ease.
* **Transparency** :: Know exactly what data is stored and shared.
* **Ecosystem** :: Build tools once, work with many providers.
